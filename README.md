POC app for Bible Trivia

To use, you must have Bower and Node installed. I am currently using:
Node - 0.10.32
Bower - 1.3.11

Pull master, then run the following command `npm install`
This will get you up to speed.

Then, run `grunt dev` and a `dist` folder will be created where you can view the index.html

A live version of this app can be viewed at http://davidmoritz.github.io/trivia_bible/
